#Max's Big To Do List

## Emails

### School

* Email Liel & Joost

Liel and Joost,

Following up on the possibility of talking. The schedule for the colloquium is coming together and I think the ideal time would be to meet around noon or later after we come back from Spring Break, which for us ends on Friday March, 21. We have been scheduling our colloquia meetings, on Mondays and Fridays this semester at around 12:00 PM, so you could hop on that schedule, or we could shoot for another date and a more intimate setting than our usual room. Burcu and I are also still discussing a more casual venue all together. However, is there a Monday or Friday, at noon, from March 24 through April that might work for you both? Let me know and we can work from there. Burcu and I are both looking forward to hearing from you both. We hope all is well, including the family.

Sincerely,
Max

* Email Liel separately

Liel,

I just sent you and Joost an email, but would definitely like to catch up before then. Sorry we keep missing each other, but I think third time's a charge. Finishing up a journal article that will occupy my time through January 16, but I could be available beyond there. I will definitely send a follow up. Feel like I owe you a drink and a toast to the newest member of your family and a few other things! Hope all is well generally and look forward to seeing you soon.

Sincerely,
Max

* Email Taylor Owen

Taylor,

I think we have met for a few minutes, but to reintroduce myself, my name is Max and I'm a member of the Communications program. I have been working quite a bit with Dennis Tenen at piracyLab and Charles Berret, both of whom have told me quite a few times that we should meet. I was hoping with the new semester around the corner that I might grab a cup of coffee with you and talk about Tow, as well as well as some of the work I have been doing, and specifically to see my research interests might align with, or be of aid to those at Tow. I am generally busy through January 16, finishing up a journal article with Dennis, but would be happy to talk more after that.

Sincerely,
Maxwell Foxman

Hello David,

My name is Maxwell Foxman and I am a PhD student, studying Communications at Columbia University. When José van Dijck came to our school and spoke at our colloquium this previous semester, she mentioned that I should speak to you about my research, which focuses broadly on Internet Culture. I am particularly interested in how the web might incite playful activity, and as a consequence have looked quite a bit at gamification, but also have tried to see the relationship between play and transgression on the web, as well as mobile dating applications, among other things. José thought you might be able to provide some insight on how to proceed ahead with my own studies, which certainly are informed by game studies and mobile media. I would be incredibly interested in hearing more about your own work, and if you could answer some more specific questions, I would be very appreciative. I don't know if you are planning on coming to New York City any time soon, but I would gladly buy you a drink or a cup of coffee if you were, and if not, would happily chat via email, or Skype. Whatever you find convenient! Thanks in advance for any and all help. I look forward to chatting more soon.

Sincerely,
Max
