#Max's Big To Do List

## Emails

### School

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Email Liel & Joost

Email to Burcu:

Burcu,

Just following up on a few things. I am going to plan on emailing Liel and Joost about them coming to speak. I am thinking it might be nice for them to come after Spring Break, (late March/Early April). Currently we have some openings and I thought that would work... I think them talking together and maybe even making it a bit more formal might be good... but we can figure that out upon their arrival. Would a bit of wine & cheese be at all in budget if it is still small?

Let me know. Either way, I am going to get them to suggest some later dates in the season.

Talk to you soon,
Max
