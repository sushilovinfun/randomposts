#Max's Big To Do List

## Emails

### School

* Email Liel & Joost

Liel and Joost,

Happy New Year! Following up on the possibility of talking: The schedule for the colloquium is coming together and I think the ideal time would be to meet around noon or later after we come back from Spring Break, which for us ends on Friday, March 21. We have been scheduling our colloquia meeting, on Mondays and Fridays this semester at around 12:00 PM, so you could hop on that schedule, or we could shoot for another date and a more intimate setting than our usual room. Burcu and I are also still discussing a more casual venue all together. However, is there a Monday or Friday from March 24 through April that might work for you both? Let me know and we can work from there. Burcu and I are really looking forward to hearing from you both. We hope all is well, including the family.

Sincerely,
Max

* Email Liel separately

Liel,

I just sent you and Joost an email, but would definitely like to catch up before then. Sorry we keep missing each other, but I think the third time's the charm! I'm currenlty finishing up a journal article that will occupy my time through January 16, but I could schedule something for the week of the 20th. I will definitely send a follow up. Feel like I owe you a drink and a toast to the newest member of your family and a few other things! Hope all is well generally and look forward to seeing you soon.

Sincerely,
Max

Hello David,

My name is Maxwell Foxman and I am a PhD student, studying Communications at Columbia University. When José van Dijck came to our school and spoke at our colloquium this previous semester, she mentioned that I should speak to you about my research, which focuses broadly on Internet Culture. I am particularly interested in how the web might incite playful activity, and as a consequence have looked quite a bit at gamification, but I have also explored relationship between play and transgression on the web, as well as mobile dating applications, among other things. José thought you might be able to provide some insight on how to proceed ahead with my own studies, which certainly are informed by game studies and mobile media. I would be incredibly interested in hearing more about your own work, and if you could answer some more specific questions, I would be very appreciative. I don't know if you are planning on coming to New York City any time soon, but I would gladly buy you a drink or a cup of coffee if you were! If not, I  would happily chat via email or Skype. Whatever you find convenient! Thanks in advance for any and all help. I look forward to chatting more soon.

Sincerely,
Max

Thomas,

My name is Maxwell Foxman and I am a PhD student, studying Communications at Columbia University. When José van Dijck came to our school and spoke at our colloquium this previous semester, she mentioned that I should speak to you about my research, which focuses broadly on Internet Culture. However, I have also done some work on social movements and José thought I might knowledge of RCADE, the debt resistence movement from Spain which in the early 2000s used networking and Internet metaphors in their rhetoric. You may know all about RCADE, so I apologize if the summary was at all repetitive. However, I would definitely be interested in hearing about your own work, which I understand has to do with social media and activitism, according to José. If you have any time to chat, either via email or Skype, I would greatly appreciate it! I look forward to hopefully speaking to you soon.

Sincerely,
Max

José,

I hope the new year finds you well. I just wanted to provide you with a brief update on some of our conversations from when you visited Columbia last semester. I have sent out the CFP to our listserv and am hoping to organize a panel. I, myself, am thinking of submitting some work on what I have been calling "conspicuous collection," and "peer preservation" which I have been studying in terms of piracy communities. However, that is still a bit up in the air and will depend on the work my potential co-presenters from CU will want to do in the panel. I have also sent messages to David and Thomas, regarding their work. I remembered that you also recommending a summer institute in the Netherlands that you thought might be a good fit for me, potentially about either games or social media, and I was wondering if I could direct me to more information about it. I also am proceeding ahead with some experiments in methodology based on our conversation, doing a multi-modal analysis of daily habits online, starting with phenomenology, but working my way concentrically outward. Todd Gitlin has agreed to help me a bit with it and I am hoping to have some more progress with that by the end of the semester. I hope your work is going well. I ended up reading a fair amount of your work and writing a bit about it for a class where I discussed memory, social media and gamification software. It was incredibly helpful. I hope to see you in the Netherlands in 2014, or some time soon and thanks again for all of the help.

Sincerely,
Max

* Email Klaus -- Formal proposal should be ready

Klaus,

Thanks for getting back to me. Why don't we start via email and can move to phone if necessary. To start the conversation, I appreciated your article for First Monday and the talk that you gave. Particularly, I was interested in the colloquium how many of the questions revolved around your categories for your four prototypes of meta-communication. As I believe I said during the talk, my understanding was that these prototypical forms existed simultaneously in various media. So, if an example of a data-based media platform, such as Facebook, all of these prototypes are present. First, I wanted to confirm that my instinct was correct again, but then I was thinking of developing a case study to test out forms of meta-communication and see how they emerged within the example. I was wondering if you had any suggestions of what you thought might act as a good case study. I thought a "cookie" would be interesting, because it certainly strikes me as a good example of meta-communication about an individual, but thought you might have something in mind. I was also wondering, frankly, if you had any interest in working on the case study with me, and perhaps producing something from it, be it an article, presentation, or just notes for future research. 

Also, as a slight tangent on Bateson, I have done some work on gamification and play, particularly using the social media application Foursquare, where I talked about how what I called "Proximal Communication" (communicating time and space rather than place) occurs with the application, and enables new forms of competition. This strikes me as similar to, though not exactly like, Bateson's meta-communicative notions. I am wondering if Foursquare might even be a good example of what I am suggesting above.

At any rate, I realize this might be a bit much to respond to, but let me know any thoughts, including if you would like to respond via Skype and we can go from there. I hope I am not being too bold in suggesting applying your theories to a specific case study, but I think it might produce some interesting work.

Sincerely,
Max

* Email Chris Hill & Fred Turner -- suggest some sort of informal meeting but also ask Chris what he thinks is best

Professor Turner,

My name is Maxwell Foxman and I am a PhD candidate at Columbia University's Communications program. I believe we met briefly through at the Extending Play conference at Rutgers this past April. I, along with Burcu Baykurt ('CCed), are organizing the colloquium this year. We were told by Richard John that you were coming to speak at the History Department at Columbia in April and might be interested in meeting with some of the members of our program. We certainly have students, myself included, interested in your work, and were thinking we could do something around the same as your presentation. We were interested in knowing what you might be intreterested in doing. Our instinct was to do something a bit less formal, where you were able to meet and speak with students about your and our projects around a general theme, possibly over lunch before your presentation, or afterward over some wine and cheese. Would this be of interest to you and do you have a theme that would appeal to you? If not, we certainly can do something more formal, decide a theme and let you know about it, or something completely different, but we wanted to contact you before moving ahead and get an idea of what would be most ideal. I look forward to you coming to Columbia and hope to see you in April!

Sincerely,
Max

* You should also reach out to Zachary Fitz-Walter <z.fitz-walter@qut.edu.au>, who is currently in the process of doing a lit review (on gamification) for writing up his thesis as well.

Hello Zachary,

My name is Maxwell Foxman and I am a PhD student in Communications at Columbia University, where I am studying gamification, ludification and playfulness on the web. Sebastian Deterding suggested I contact you about your thesis, as we both are constructing literature reviews for gamification. If you had any time to discuss what you have found, or trade resources, I would be very grateful. What exactly are your studying about gamification? Sebastian didnt' say. Thanks in advance for any and all help.

Sincerely,
Max

* Email Finn Brunton -- Possibly after or before. Maybe check in with Brett Gary about name dropping - Checked in with Burcu about this already

* Send out CFP to listserv

Hello All:

Happy New Year! José send me the attached CFP for her conference in June concerning Social Media and the Public Sphere. She encouraged me to say that they are open to and interested in panels from our program. I certainly would happily take the lead in beginning to organize one for any interested parties. If you would like to put something together, please contact me off-server... I think we could put together something pretty interesting.

Sincerely,
Max

* Email Matt Jones -- Send a check-in email to Charles

Matt,

Apologies that we haven't been in touch for so long. I think a busy course schedule caused at least Charles and I to be in radio silence for a majority of the semester. At any rate,  I wanted to follow up and get any balls rolling with the project. Charles and I can still work on the information you gave us, and can also move the data we were able to get over the summer to your server, if we can gain access. Personally, I am eager to take up what we spoke about last, and just wanted to see if you had any time frames, concerns or questions before I get back to what I was doing with gusto.

Many thanks for the patience and hope to be in touch soon. If you would like to organize a meeting between the three of us, I know we are in town, and I will be available for at least a short meeting most weekdays. I can have a meeting for over an hour in length starting January 17.

Sincerely,
Max
